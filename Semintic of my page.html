          <p>
            <b>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</b>, trading as
            <b>BMW Group</b> (commonly abbreviated to <b>BMW</b> (German
            pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] ⓘ), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian
            Motor Works), is a German multinational manufacturer of luxury
            vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany.
            The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft
            engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to
            1945 creating engines for aircraft that were used in the Second
            World War.

            The company's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and
            Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles are marketed under the BMW
            Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world's ninth-largest producer
            of motor vehicles, and the 6th largest by revenue,[3] with 2,555,341
            vehicles produced in that year alone.[4] In 2023, the company was
            ranked 46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[5] The company has
            significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports
            cars, and the Isle of Man TT.

            BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in
            Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico,
            South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands
            (ceased in 2023).[6] The Quandt family [de] is a long-term
            shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers
            Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959 that saved BMW from bankruptcy,
            with the remaining shares owned by the public.
